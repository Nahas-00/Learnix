  <h1>About Learnix</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">
  <p><strong>Learnix</strong> is a student-built web platform designed to enhance programming skills through structured, topic-wise learning. Created with simplicity and accessibility in mind, Learnix aims to offer a distraction-free environment for problem-solving and knowledge growth.</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>“Learning should be guided, structured, and self-paced — Learnix was created to reflect exactly that.”</strong>
  </div>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>We aim to help beginner and intermediate coders build strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and programming logic through well-categorized questions and hints.</p>

  <h2>Key Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Make problem-solving accessible and structured</li>
    <li>Encourage learning by topic and difficulty</li>
    <li>Support users with hints and solutions for better understanding</li>
    <li>Provide a clean and responsive interface for smooth practice</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who Built Learnix?</h2>
  <p>Learnix was built by <strong>Nahas</strong> as a personal academic project. The goal was not only to apply web development knowledge but to solve a real challenge faced by many learners — where to practice in an organized way.</p>

  <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
  <p>We plan to grow Learnix into a broader community-driven tool with features like real-time coding editors, user performance tracking, and even mentor-based guidance. The current version is the MVP and will evolve based on user feedback.</p>
